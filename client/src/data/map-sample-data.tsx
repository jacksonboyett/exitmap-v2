      "Pedra de Gavea is easily one of the most beautiful jumps in the world. There are truly no other jumps like this anywhere in the world. Start the experience by hiking through the lush jungles of Brazil, up through the famous cloud forests, and on top of one of Rio's highest mountains to get a 270 degree view of the city. The jump itself is amazing, and the flight is long. Land on the beach and get a morning beer.",

    access_approach:
      "Park at the Sao Conrado beach parking area, and then from there take an Uber to the Gavea trailhead. There is a guard shack at the trailhead, so it is best to hop the fence about 75 meters to the right of the guard shack. From there, follow the creek until you hit the road. Take that path all the wayt to the top of the mountain. The exit point is on the east side of the moutain.",
    landing_area:
      "The landing areas for this jump are massive. The primary landing area is the paraglider landing area next to the Sao Conrado roundabout. You can also land on the beach if you want to, just watch out for people. It is not adives to jump Gavea with a wind coming from the ocean. There have been many jumpers who have not been able to make the landing area and they have had to land in the neighborhoods at the base of the mountain, and there are no good landing areas there.",
